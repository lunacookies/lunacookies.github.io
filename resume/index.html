              I made a statically-typed compiler and VS Code plugin using Rust
              for a programming language of my own design. I optimised the
              compiler heavily for performance, reaching over 1 million
              LOC/second on a&nbsp;single&nbsp;core.
            </p>
            <details>
              <summary>more…</summary>
              <p>
                I wrote the compiler in a modular fashion to allow reusing its
                infrastructure to create editor plugins. Out of this came an
                LSP-based VS Code plugin which provided semantic highlighting,
                Go to Definition, Expand/Shrink Selection, Workspace Symbols as
                well as live as-you-type diagnostics.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve performance I structured the entire compiler to
                operate on each source file independently during every phase,
                thereby making it trivial to add multithreading. I profiled the
                compiler on large test inputs to find areas in need of
                optimisation. This resulted in my implementation of a custom
                syntax tree data structure. Additionally, for several
                particularly hot functions, I read their disassemblies and
                tweaked the relevant source code to eliminate bounds checks.

          <h3>Timetable Bot</h3>

              A friend and I successfully created a Discord bot, written in
              Rust, to provide lesson time notifications. It was very satisfying
              when over 250 students at our school used it!
            </p>

                We scraped the timetable of every student from the school’s
                website. This let us automatically send each student a
                notification through Discord when a class of theirs was about to
                start. These messages included a link to the roll call website
                of the relevant class.
              </p>
              <p>
                We set up a Discord server for the entire school and managed to
                get over 250 members! Through the Discord bot, we created an
                automated authentication system to only provide server access to
                students verified through the school’s timetable website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once school went back to in-person learning, we added a
                timetable export feature to the bot that could emit timetables
                in the format expected by the popular
                <a href="https://classtimetable.app">Class Timetable</a> app.

              I made an interpreted programming language in Rust to be used as a
              shell. Its standout feature was the integration of applications
              into the shell to provide a consistent command-line interface.

            <p>
              I’m interested in color theory and color science, as well as the
              application of mathematical rigor to color schemes, especially
              syntax highlighting. Along the way I’ve implemented libraries in
              Rust for generating colors using perceptually uniform color spaces
              and for creating VS Code themes. I’ve also made a number of
              popular color schemes for Vim (<a

            requests could be made.
