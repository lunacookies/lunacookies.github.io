Earlier this year, I began a project that aims to create a development environment that is orthogonal, fast, and pleasant to use. It would be difficult for one person to write this all by themselves; my aim was to create but a few of the components involved in such a project. My focus started with the shell, which I called Fjord. Then, my focus shifted to creating a text editor.</description></item><item><title>A New Direction for Fjord</title><link>https://arzg.github.io/blog/new-direction/</link><pubDate>

Some context Fjord is a project I’m working on. It started off as a ‘shell’ that has all the applications you want to run from it baked into the shell itself; essentially, a scripting language with the ability to call Rust functions. The plan was for Fjord to be used primarily as a shell &amp;ndash; that is, a shell that cannot run programs, only call functions. Stupid, I know.
Why Fjord is the way it is I’ve always been interested in Plan 9 and its philosophy &amp;ndash; Unix turned up to eleven, as they say.</description></item></channel></rss>
