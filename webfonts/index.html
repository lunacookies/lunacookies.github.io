about how websites are becoming
increasingly bloated.
I understand this sentiment,
completely.</p><p>One of the culprits which is often mentioned
(alongside invasive advertising
and mountains of JavaScript)
is (are?) webfonts.
I’ve seen them be derided for being
a pointless waste of hundreds of kilobytes
or perhaps even megabytes of bandwidth
per page load,
solely to cultivate a “brand image”
or because some designer
thought they looked nice.</p><p>In today’s era of <code>system-ui</code> & co,
beautiful typography is possible in browsers
without loading any external typefaces.
Does anyone have
an excuse to use webfonts anymore?</p><p>This website used to just use Georgia.
I’m a typography and type design nerd, though.
I couldn’t resist picking some pretty typefaces
and updating my website to use them.</p><p>Can you tell the difference between
the font I’ve used and some random built-in font?
Do you care?
Are you at least mildly annoyed
I used up 118 kilobytes of <em>your</em> data
to load these fonts
because <em>I</em> like them?
Or am I being completely reasonable,
since this is, after all,
my website and my form of
personal creative expression?</p><p class=signature><a href=https://lunacookies.github.io/>Luna Razzaghipour</a><br>17 February 2023</p><footer><p>Thoughts, comments, corrections or suggestions?
